# Billing policy


## Billing policy

#. We don't accept fixed price projects as it makes impossible to reach good results trying to align all 
   requirements within the budget. But it's also unfair to put all risks to the client, so we need to follow
   the rules listed below to make collaboration smooth and fair.


### Budgetting tasks policy

#. Tasks or time periods might have budgets we must respect
#. Each budget need to be defined and reviewed daily on daily meetings

### Research tasks policy

#. We must identify *research* tasks where we may not receive any obvious result and inform client
#. On each research task we must receive written approval on doing research work with defined budget of hours
#. In case if DB goes over the budget we should put this timing into `overbudget` group


## Credit policy

#. Each invoice is delivered and approves no later than 4 weeks after the work was delivered
#. Past due invoices is grouped per number of weeks, W0, W1, W2, W3, W4, etc.
